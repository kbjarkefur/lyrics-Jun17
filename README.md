# Intro to Git and GitHub training

This repository was created for a training in Git and GitHub at DIME Analytics. If you do not know the difference between Git and GitHub, then this training is for you!

As a part of this training we are sharing great lyrics! We do this as this training does not depend on a specific programming language or a certain level of coding skill, and because code becomes a distraction for those participants that do not know what the code means. Instead we are working in lyrics in .txt files and those files behaves just the way code files behaves on Git.

We hope you will end up liking Git as much as we do!
