There's all kinds of music, everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast, and some like it slow
Some like it hot, some like it blue
Uh some like it old, and some like it new
Now I'm not liking country, and I'm not rappin' rap
You can make a man swing, just say my thing
No, I'm talkin' to dig, my step
The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
Music makes you happy, thinking makes you sad
It can do the worst thing to the best you ever had
For entertainment found you if you had to choose
You and me might disagree, 'cause I like rhythm and blues
Now I'm not missin' disco, I'm not saying punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal, 'cause I got to have that funk
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
Oh, there's people who tell you to get in with the times
It doesn't even matter that if your poem rimes
But I'm here to tell you, whatever comes along
There's something that gave up everyone and there ain't no right or
wrong
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
Some rock makes you lazy
Highschool leaves you flat
Fusion drives you crazy
That's now funk is where it's at
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
Play that funky groove
