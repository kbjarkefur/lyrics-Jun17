Think
Aretha Franklin
You better think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Think (think-think) let your mind go
Let yourself be free
Let's go back, let's go back
A let's go way on to way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't a been too much more than ten (just a child)
I ain't no psychiatrist
I ain't no doctor with degrees
But it don't take too much I.Q.
To see what you're doing to me
You better think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Yeah, think (think-think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
Oh freedom (freedom)
Oh freedom
Oh, freedom (yeah)
Oh freedom
Oh freedom (freedom)
Oh freedom
Oh freedom
Oh ya got to have
Hey! think about it
You! think about it
There ain't nothin' you could ask
I could answer you with "I won't" (I won't)
But I was gonna change my mind
If you keep doin' things I don't (don't)
You better think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' ta do to me
(What you're tryin' to do to me)
Oh-oh-oh think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
People walk around everyday
Playin' games and takin' scores
Tryin' to make other people lose their mind
Well, be careful you don't lose yours
Ooh think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Woo-hoo, think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
You need me (need me)
And I need you (don't cha' know)
Without each other
There ain't nothin' either can do
Oooh yeah, think about it, baby
(What 'cha tryin' to do to me, think)
Better go baby, think about it right now
Yeah, right now (tell about - forgiveness)
Woo, right now (tell about - forgiveness)
Hey, right now (tell about - forgiveness)
I need to change your mind (think about it)
Baby, baby, baby
(Tell about it - forgiveness)
Woo, tell about it baby (tell about - forgiveness)
FADES-
Yeah, woo-hoo (tell about - forgiveness)
Tell about it baby, you think about it right now
