So tenderly
Your story is
Nothing more
Than what you see
Or
What you've done
Or will become
Standing strong
Do you belong
In your skin
Just wondering
Gentle now
The tender breeze
Blows
Whispers through
My Gran Torino
Whistling another
Tired song
Engine humms
And bitter dreams
Grow heart locked
In a Gran Torino
It beats
A lonely rhythm
All night long
It beats
A lonely rhythm
All night long
It beats
A lonely rhythm
All night long
Realign all
The stars
Above my head
Warning signs
Travel far
I drink instead
On my own
Oh how I've known
The battle scars
And worn out beds
Gentle now
A tender breeze
Blows
Whispers through
A Gran Torino
Whistling another
Tired song
Engines humm
And bitter dreams
Grow
Heart locked
In a Gran Torino
It beats
A lonely rhythm
All night long
These streets
Are old
They shine
Withâ€¦
